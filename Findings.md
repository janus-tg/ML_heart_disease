# Introduction


According to the W.H.O, heart diseases or Cardiovascular diseases are the **number one cause of death globally** and claimed an estimated **17.9 million each year**. Through this project, I plotted graphs, using matplotlib and seaborn, and observed the various trends between the risk factors for heart diseases. Then, I created a **Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and Gaussian Naive Bayes** ML models to try and predict the heart disease. Lastly, utilising those models, I created plots for feature importance to see which risk factors are most important in predicting heart diseases. I believe that this can be play an important role in weighing these features to create more accurate models.
