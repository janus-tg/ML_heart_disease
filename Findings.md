# Introduction


According to the W.H.O, heart diseases or Cardiovascular diseases are the **number one cause of death globally** and claimed an estimated **17.9 million each year**. Through this project, I plotted graphs, using matplotlib and seaborn, and observed the various trends between the risk factors for heart diseases. Then, I created a **Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and Gaussian Naive Bayes** ML models to try and predict the heart disease. Lastly, utilising those models, I created plots for feature importance to see which risk factors are most important in predicting heart diseases. I believe that this can be play an important role in weighing these features to create more accurate models. 


# Getting Started


I am using the Cleveland Heart Disease data set which is available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
This dataset consists of data from 303 people. All the columns of the dataset are described below:
1. Age: age of person in years.
2. Sex: gender of person:
      - 1 = male
      - 0 = female
3. Chest-pain type: displays the type of chest-pain:
      - 1 = typical angina
      - 2 = atypical angina
      - 3 = non-anginal pain
      - 4 = asymptomatic
4. Resting Blood Pressure: resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg
5. Serum Cholestrol: serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. Fasting Blood Sugar: compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl.
      - fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl: 1 (true)
      - else: 0 (false)
7. Resting ECG: electrocardiographic test results:
      - 0 = normal
      - 1 = ST-T wave abnormality
      - 2 = left ventricular hypertrophy
8. Max heart rate: max heart rate achieved
9. Exercise induced angina:
      - 1 = yes
      - 0 = no
10. ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest: displays the value which is an integer or float.
11. Peak exercise ST segment:
       - 1 = upsloping
       - 2 = flat
       - 3 = downsloping
12. Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by flourosopy : indicates number of blood vessels affected.
13. Thalassemia:
      - 3 = normal
      - 6 = fixed defect
      - 7 = reversible defect
14. Diagnosis of heart disease:
      - 0 = absence
      - 1, 2, 3, 4 = present.
