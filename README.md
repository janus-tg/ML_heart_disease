# Data analysis and Machine Learning models to predict heart disease

A python3 program which used data analysis techniques to observe trends between various risk factors for heart diseases. Then, machine leaning models were created to predict whether a person has heart disease based on those risk factors. **[See my findings here](https://medium.com/@janus_tg/data-analysis-and-machine-learning-models-to-predict-heart-disease-ea3b6afd7f8d)!

## Setup

### Installation

1. Install ```Python 3.7``` or above.
2. Install these modules:
    - NumPy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - scikit-learn


## Running the program

1. Download the ```cleveland.csv``` file and ```heart_disease.py``` files.
2. Place them inside the same folder.
3. Open the aforementioned folder in your terminal (for MacOS and Linux) or command prompt (for Windows).
4. Type ```python heart_disease.py``` and press enter to run the program.

**OR**

1. Install any IDE.
2. Create a new project, copy the ```heart_disease.py``` code and paste it in a ```.py``` file.
3. Run the program.
